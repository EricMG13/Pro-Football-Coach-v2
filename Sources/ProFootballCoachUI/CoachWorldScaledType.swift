import SwiftUI

/// The one place a custom-sized font may be constructed in `ProFootballCoachUI`.
///
/// S-0, 2026-08-19 adversarial review: `CoachWorldTokens.display(_:weight:)` and
/// `figure(_:weight:)` returned `.system(size:weight:)` with no `relativeTo:`, so no custom-sized
/// text in the app grows under Dynamic Type — every `isAccessibilitySize` branch elsewhere in the
/// codebase reflows *layout* around type that never changes size. `04` section 6.2 states the rule
/// this file exists to satisfy: *"Custom sizes are wrapped in `@ScaledMetric` so the default
/// composition remains dense while accessibility categories can expand and reflow it."*
///
/// `@ScaledMetric` can only live on a stored property that SwiftUI re-evaluates against the current
/// environment, which a static function returning a bare `Font` cannot provide. This file is that
/// property's one home: a `ViewModifier` whose `@ScaledMetric` is seeded from a caller-supplied base
/// size via the underscored-backing-storage initialiser SwiftUI provides for exactly this case, and
/// three `View` extension methods — `coachWorldDisplay`/`coachWorldFigure`/`coachWorldIcon` — that are
/// the scaling replacements for `CoachWorldTokens.display`/`figure` and for the raw
/// `.font(.system(size:weight:))` sites that size an SF Symbol rather than text. A source scan should
/// eventually assert that `.system(size:` and `CoachWorldTokens.display(`/`figure(` no longer appear
/// as a `.font(...)` argument outside this file and `DesignTokens.swift` itself, the same shape
/// `MotionContractTests.swift` already uses for `CoachWorldMotion.swift`.
///
/// `relativeTo:` defaults to `.body` for every caller that does not name one. Canon gives an exact
/// text-style mapping for the six semantic roles (`TypeRole.display/.title/.headline/.body/
/// .callout/.caption`, `04` section 6.2 lines 626-632) — already implemented and already scaling —
/// but gives no equivalent mapping for `DisplaySize`'s granular numeric scale (66 down to 9). `.body`
/// is SwiftUI's own default for an unspecified `@ScaledMetric` and produces a single, uniform,
/// predictable growth rate; picking a materially different rate per size is a design judgement this
/// file does not make unilaterally. A call site that has a real reason to grow faster or slower may
/// pass a specific `textStyle`.
