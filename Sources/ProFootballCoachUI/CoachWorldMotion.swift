/// or `.coachWorldPulse(active:)`, which is what makes an off-token duration, an un-reduced
/// animation, or a second easing curve **unrepresentable** rather than merely something a review
/// might catch. `04` section 6.7 is the canonical register these durations are drawn from, and this
/// file is the only place that register's raw vocabulary — `Animation.timingCurve`,
/// `withAnimation`, `.repeatForever` — is permitted to appear. A source scan asserts that; see
/// `Tests/SimTests/Suites/MotionContractTests.swift`.
///
/// `04:826`: Reduce Motion replaces travel, reveal and field animation with discrete state changes.
/// Both modifiers below read `\.accessibilityReduceMotion` themselves, so a call site cannot forget
/// the branch — there is only one way to call either of them, and it is already reduced-motion-safe.

/// `04` section 6.7's one shared curve, applied to a duration. `CoachWorldTokens.Motion` holds only
/// data — the named durations, as plain numbers — precisely so that constructing an actual
/// `Animation` from them, which is behaviour, stays confined to this file rather than requiring an
/// exemption on the token file every view already reads.
