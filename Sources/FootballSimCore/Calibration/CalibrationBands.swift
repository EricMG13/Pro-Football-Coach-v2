/// The band tables, transcribed from `01-RESEARCH.md` §6.5.
///
/// **Transcribed, not invented.** Every row carries the confidence grade `01` §0.1 assigned it, so
/// a failure report can say how much the band itself is worth: a `provisional [U]` band failing is
/// a different event from a `[C]` band failing, and treating them alike is how a gate gets widened
/// to make a red light go away.
///
/// `03` §5.2 records what that looks like: the prior suite's overtime band was `0.008…0.14`, a
/// seventeen-fold range. "That is what widening a band to stop a false failure looks like. Under
/// TOST the correct response to a band that will not hold is to fix the model or state the margin
/// honestly, never to widen until green."
///
/// **Not every band in §6.5 is here yet.** The ones that need machinery P3 does not have — per-drive
/// accounting, target shares, overtime, postseason context, non-conference mismatch splits — are
/// listed in `unimplementedMetrics` rather than silently dropped, because a band table that quietly
/// covers two thirds of §6.5 is the coverage-boundary failure `CLAUDE.md` names.
