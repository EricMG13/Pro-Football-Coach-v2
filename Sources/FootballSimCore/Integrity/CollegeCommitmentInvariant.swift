/// chain, and a class that fits the capacity it was reserved against — stated once so they can be
/// asserted **after a transaction** rather than only on a root at rest.
///
/// Uniqueness is structural here rather than counted: a prospect holds one
/// `ProspectRecruitmentState`, and the programme it names is the last winner in its own history.
/// What that structure cannot say on its own is whether the history is a legal chain, whether the
/// programmes it names exist, and whether the programme on the other end can still hold the class
/// it has accumulated. Those are the limbs below.
///
/// The calendar limbs `WorldIntegrity` also applies — a commitment must not be dated in the future
/// relative to `state.calendar` — stay there. The season boundary moves `college.recruitingSeason`
/// several transactions before the calendar follows, so a calendar limb asserted after every
/// transaction would report the scheduler's own ordering as a breach.
