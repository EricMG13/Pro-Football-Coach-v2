/// Moves the map by swapping programmes between conferences.
///
/// `02` §8 asks for a map the player does not leave as they found it. This is the half of it that
/// changes who plays whom.
///
/// **A swap, not a migration, for a structural reason.** A conference holds 12 to 16 programmes
/// summing to 134, and schedule generation, standings, tiebreaks and whole-root topology integrity
/// all read that shape. A one-way move makes one conference 11 and another 17, so every one of those
/// would have to cope with a size the rules forbid. A swap leaves each conference exactly the size it
/// was, so the map changes while nothing downstream can observe a shape it was not built for.
///
/// The pair taken is the one that most improves **geographic fit** — each programme scored by the
/// distance from its city to the centroid of its conference's cities — and only when the swap lowers
/// the total. Performance and market enter through prestige, which already follows the table.
