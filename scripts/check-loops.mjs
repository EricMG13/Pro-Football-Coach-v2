// Validate docs/loops/catalog.json.
//
// Three checks, in order of what they protect:
//
//   1. Schema. The field set, length caps and formats are the Loop Library publication schema, so a
//      record here can be submitted without rework. Rules transcribed from Forward-Future/loop-library
//      at commit 75966cb, loop-library/worker/src/loop-schema.js (MIT). Nothing is vendored; if the
//      upstream schema moves, this file is what has to move with it.
//   2. Reference integrity. Every `related` slug resolves inside this catalog, so the series has no
//      dangling links.
//   3. The partition. Every aspect in aspects.json names at least one loop, and every loop is named
//      by at least one aspect. This is the project's own convention applied to its loop series: the
//      two legal sweeps must partition every generated name because a name that belongs to neither
//      kind is a name nothing checks. A loop nothing points at covers nothing anybody asked for.
//
// Plus a drift check: LOOPS.md must carry the same slugs and the same exact prompt text as the
// catalog, so the register an agent reads cannot quietly diverge from the record that was validated.
//
// Usage: node scripts/check-loops.mjs                  validate
//        node scripts/check-loops.mjs --write-register  regenerate LOOPS.md from the catalog, then validate

const PREAMBLE = `# Project loops

Repeatable agent loops for finding and patching **unknown** faults in this project: faults no current
assertion is shaped to detect. Each one widens a detector first and runs it second, because running an
existing gate can only re-find faults that gate already knows how to see.

Format and method follow the Loop Library at <https://signals.forwardfuture.com/loop-library/>. The full
records, with steps, verification detail and rationale, are \`docs/loops/catalog.json\`; this file is the
register an agent reads. \`scripts/check-loops.mjs\` fails if the two disagree, so edit the catalog and
regenerate rather than editing here.

**These files carry no canon authority.** \`docs/DOC-MANIFEST.md\` is the authority on what is canon, and
nothing below amends a design decision. A loop that turns out to need one stops and says so.

## Standing rules every loop inherits

1. **Widen, then run.** A pass that only re-runs an existing check has not looked anywhere new.
2. **Fix the system, never the instrument.** Never widen a calibration band, relax an invariant,
   re-record a fingerprint, add a scan exemption or delete a commitment to reach green.
3. **Enumerate by construction.** A check over a hand-written list stops covering the codebase the day
   after it is written.
4. **Stop honestly.** Terminal states are success, clean no-op, blocked, approval required, exhausted
   and no progress. An error is never success, and an exhausted budget is never success.
5. **No progress means stop.** Absent a limit the owner set, stop after two consecutive passes that
   widen coverage and find nothing.
6. **Canon first.** A gameplay decision is amended in the documents before it is implemented. Never
   encode a design decision only in code.
7. **Escalate, do not resolve.** Legal identity questions, owner gates, device measurement and
   simulator walkthroughs are not agent decisions.
8. **Never claim an unrun gate.** With no Swift toolchain a loop stops as blocked. Write the code to the
   same standard, record it in \`docs/STATUS.md\` as unverified and never compiled, and do not report a
   build or a test run that did not happen.
9. **Hand the long run off.** Where a loop carries a companion prompt, its verification is a soak or a
   sweep measured in tens of minutes. Do not sit through it: widen the detector, then hand the companion
   to a second agent with the commit named, and carry on. The companion reports and never fixes, so the
   two halves cannot race on the same tree.
