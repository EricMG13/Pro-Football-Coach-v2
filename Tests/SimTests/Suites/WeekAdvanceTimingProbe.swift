/// D4 budgets a week advance at 2.0 s and a frame at 16.7 ms, and
/// `docs/plans/2026-08-12-road-to-beta.md` records both as never measured on anything. This measures

/// it were: a development Mac is several times faster than an iPhone under thermal load, so a
/// comfortable number here is evidence that the shape is right, not that the budget holds.
///
/// It is a probe, not a gate: it prints and asserts nothing about the budget, because a machine
/// this does not know the speed of cannot fairly fail a build. The gate is the owner's, on the
