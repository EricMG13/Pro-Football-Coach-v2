/// Pinned play-by-play fingerprints. See "the play-by-play fingerprint is pinned across processes".
/// Moved on 2026-08-22 merging origin/main into `agent/floodlit-injury-evidence`. The clock
/// constants this branch tuned -- `normalTempoSnapSeconds` and `readyForPlaySeconds` -- landed on
/// top of origin/main's resolver rework, so the same seed now runs a different number of snaps.
///
/// Moved a second time in `0a2b641`, "Calibrate two-tier game statistics and scoring rules" -- a
/// second contributor's calibration work landed on this branch concurrently with the merge above,
/// through `2aab277` and further uncommitted changes before reaching that commit. Re-pinning was
/// held until that work reached a real commit rather than chasing values still moving underneath
/// it. Reproduced in three independent release processes in a clean worktree at `0a2b641`.
/// Moved a third time on 2026-08-23, fixing the pursuit-order defect. `Assignment.assign` built
/// `pursuit` as `ranked(defense)` -- best-overall-first, and blind to the call -- and
/// `yardsAfterContact` always starts its break-tackle chain at index zero, so the highest-rated
/// defender on the field was the recorded tackler on every snap of a game. Whoever leads that list
/// is whose `tackling` the leverage reads and how many draws the chain takes, so reordering it
/// necessarily moves the stream and everything downstream of it. That is the change, not a side
/// effect of it.
///
/// The college value then moved a *second* time in the same commit, when `breakTackleThreshold`
/// was recalibrated from 0.46 to 0.60 to absorb the same effect. The pro value did not, and that is
/// worth stating rather than glossing: the threshold governs the run chain only, the window it
/// moved through is (0.46, 0.60], and no carry in the pro game at seed 12,345 happened to land in
/// it. A pin that moves for one tier and not the other is what a sensitive-but-not-universal hash
/// looks like, not a sign that half the change failed to apply -- the constant was verified in the
/// built binary and the suite rebuilt from clean before this was concluded.
///
/// Both moved again in the same session, closing the linebacker skew the first fix left behind:
/// `Assignment.atTheSecondLevel` now keys the level of the defence that meets a run on the lane
/// quality the front just gave up, and `collegeBreakTackleRelief` moved 0.05 to 0.08 to re-centre
/// the college explosive-run band that shifted with it. Three model changes, one pin move each,
/// and the pin caught every one of them -- which is the whole reason it is a literal in a source
/// file rather than a computed value.
///
/// Every value here reproduced across three independent debug processes and a release build.
