/// Both pins moved twice on 2026-08-12. First when schema 10 became schema 11: when

/// both inside the encoded root, so *every* root fingerprint moves — including a freshly
/// bootstrapped one that has archived nothing yet. That is why the root pin moves here and did not
/// move for the rivalry-ordering change, which touched a step rather than a persisted type.
/// Then again when this stopped hashing the save envelope and started hashing the canonical JSON
/// body, so a compressed envelope cannot make a determinism pin depend on zlib.
///
/// And a third time on 2026-08-12, when bootstrap began issuing professional contracts
/// (`02` section 4.2a). That is a change to the generated *state*, which is exactly what this pin
/// exists to notice, so re-pinning is the correct response rather than a workaround — unlike the
/// compression move above, where the state was identical and only its encoding had changed. The
/// generation-body pin did not move, and should not have: it hashes `LeagueGenerator.generate`,
/// and contracts are issued during bootstrap rather than league generation. Both new values were
/// reproduced in two independent processes before being written here.
/// The application root then moved from schema 11 to schema 12, and schema 13 added the durable
/// professional negotiation ledger; these values were independently reproduced after each
/// migration and are intentionally pinned to the current root contract.
/// Tactical state now also persists the bounded personnel and practice-consumption ledgers; the
/// values below were reproduced in two independent release-process invocations.
/// The advanced pin moved again when completed summaries gained an explicit abstracted/detailed
/// source discriminator, so the new controlled detailed path cannot be mistaken for an abstract
/// result after reload.
/// Both pins moved again on 2026-08-20, when `CareerArcState` gained a persisted
/// `stakeholderLastMovement` field: `careerArc` is a required, non-optional property of `GameState`
/// itself (not something that exists only once a career starts), so the new key appears in every
/// encoded root's JSON body -- including a freshly bootstrapped one where the dictionary is empty --
/// exactly the same class of move as the `DomainEventLedger` archive above, not a determinism
/// regression. Unlike the moves above, these two values were not independently reproduced across
/// two local processes before being written here -- no Swift toolchain exists in this environment
/// (`CLAUDE.md`) -- they are copied verbatim from a single CI run's own actual output for this exact
/// commit (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`, run 32319402462, job 96278385220). Cross-process
/// reproduction of a hash over a fixed seed is precisely the property this test exists to check, so
/// a second confirming run is what would actually validate that guarantee, not a second manual
/// re-derivation of the same single number.
///
/// All five pins in this file moved again on 2026-08-20, merging `claude/tighten-calibration-bands`
/// into this `stakeholderLastMovement` root: `WideReceiver`/`TightEnd` now rate `.vision` and
/// `.elusiveness` (`03` §1.2's carrier-versus-pursuit row), so every generated roster's encoded
/// shape changed alongside the field the other branch added. Root, advanced-root, negotiation-ledger
/// and match-session all exercise `GameState.bootstrap` or personnel built from it and moved;

///
/// Moved a third time merging `claude/lifecycle-band-validation-a50138`: the college talent scale
/// unified onto `RosterPopulationGenerator.baseRating`, and `.ironman`/`.volatile` joined
/// `TraitPopulationGenerator.activeTraits` behind the new weekly `disciplineFile` step. Same class of
/// move as every one above -- generated state changed, so the pin exists to notice it. Reproduced in

///
/// Moved again on 2026-08-20 when PR #9 added 30 real NFL colour pairs to the trade-dress blocklist.
/// Legitimate colour-collision retries shift the deterministic generation stream and therefore the
/// encoded root and every populated fixture derived from it. Values below came from the merged

/// matched in the GitHub release runner and an independent local release process.
/// **All six pins in this file moved on 2026-08-22, merging origin/main into
/// `agent/floodlit-injury-evidence`.** Two independent causes, both deliberate and both in that
/// merge: the nickname pools were reconciled, which changes the name every generated member
/// carries, and the abstracted model's calibration constants settled on origin/main's values,

///
/// `pinnedAdvancedRootFingerprint` and `pinnedMatchSessionFingerprint` were re-measured a second
