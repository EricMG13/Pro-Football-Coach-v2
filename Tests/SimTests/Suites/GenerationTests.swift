/// and this dropped from 824,938 bytes to 155,631. That is compression, not a generation change —
/// and the new body pin, 824,922, is the old one minus exactly the 16-byte header, which is the
/// arithmetic proof that generation itself did not move.
/// but the pin could not tell the difference, and a pin that moves when the compression library
/// moves is a cross-process assertion about zlib rather than about generation. It now hashes the
/// JSON the generator produces, which is the thing it is actually asserting.

/// Moved on 2026-08-22 merging origin/main into `agent/floodlit-injury-evidence`: the two
/// nickname pools were reconciled, and seven nouns that are real programme names were replaced in
/// place. The pool counts are unchanged, so the draw stream and every identifier keyed off it stay
/// where they were; what moved is the name each member carries, which is why the encoded world
/// grew by 1,665 bytes rather than changing shape. Reproduced in four independent release
/// processes in this worktree.
///
/// Moved on 2026-08-20 when PR #9 added the 30 real NFL colour pairs to the trade-dress blocklist.
/// The new collision retries consume a different deterministic RNG path, so this is a deliberate
/// generation change, not a per-launch instability. Values came from the merged PR #9/current-main
