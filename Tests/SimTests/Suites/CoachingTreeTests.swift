// A coaching tree is the one piece of career history a coach reads about themselves: who they came
// up under, and who came up under them. It is derived, never stored. The authority is the bounded
// staff career record M2 already keeps, and this projection is rebuilt after load exactly like
// WorldHistoryReadModel — a second persisted copy of the same facts is a second authority that can
// disagree with the first.

/// One bootstrapped world, shared. Every test here swaps in its own career records; only the staff
/// identities and their names come from the world, and generating it per test bought nothing.
