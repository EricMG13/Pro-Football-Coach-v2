// Every assertion here reads its expectation out of `docs/04-UX-AND-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` at run time
// rather than restating it. A test that hard-codes the twelve status symbols is a second copy of
// canon that drifts silently; one that parses the table fails the day canon and the tree disagree,
// which is the only reason to write it.
//
// The reference sheets shipped with every contract block self-reporting its own compliance, and the
// 2026-08-12 proof review found the predictable result: a column count that did not match its own
// drawing, a verified-sizes table that grew an unverified row, a symbol budget that only summed
// across files. Gap G-17 is this file's reason to exist — where a claim is mechanically checkable,
// it gets mechanically checked.
//
// Each scan enumerates its file set by walking a directory, per `CLAUDE.md`'s coverage-boundary
// rule, and each ships a self-test that plants an offender and asserts the scan catches it. A scan
// that has never failed is not known to be a scan.
