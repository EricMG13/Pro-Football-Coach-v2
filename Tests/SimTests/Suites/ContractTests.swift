// The four build-wide invariants from 03b section 1, in one place because that is what they are:
// properties of the whole tree, not of any suite's subject.
//
// Each scan enumerates its file set by walking a directory rather than from a hand-written list.
// AUDIT.md's lesson is that "the test's coverage boundary became the quality boundary" — a scan over
// named files covers the files someone remembered, which is the defect, not the coverage.
//
// Each scan also ships a self-test that plants an offender in a synthetic file and asserts the scan
// catches it. A scan that has never failed is not known to be a scan, and two of these exist
// specifically because the prior build's version shipped green against real violations.
//
// The self-tests deliberately include the spellings a real offender uses rather than only the
// idealised one the author had in mind: `import struct SwiftUI.Color`, `Date.now`, `Hasher()`, and
// a `.hashValue` sitting behind a URL string literal. An adversarial review of P0 planted each of
// those in the tree and watched an earlier version of this file stay green.
