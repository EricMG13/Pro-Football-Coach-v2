# Pro Football Coach

A unified college→pro football **coaching** career simulator for iPhone. One save, one coach: you
start in the college game and get promoted to the pro league. SwiftUI, offline, zero third-party
dependencies.

You are a coach, never a player. There is **no direct control of players during play** — no arcade
mode, no throwing passes. Matches are watched in a 2D view and shaped by roster construction, scheme
identity, opponent preparation, staff and in-game decisions. Every school, team, conference, city,
stadium, player and coach is fictional and original.

> **Status: the Master Build Documentation rebaseline is active. M0 architecture hardening, M1
> playable world and M2 people lifecycle are implemented; M3 college management, M4 tactical
> management, M5 career and stakes, M6 professional management and M7 living world/history have
> implemented slices, and M8 production UI is the active milestone.** The normalized deterministic
> root runs exact college and professional schedules, target-scale rosters, abstract results,
> regular-season standings, postseason brackets, awards/records, causal development, health and
> fatigue, eligibility/retirement, staff continuity, season rollover and bounded history; on top of
> it sit recruiting/portal/NIL, the professional market, tactics, the career layer, the news feed and
> history archive, a compressed versioned save, and the Floodlit design system behind the 62-family
> screen registry. M2 completed a verified 20-season college/pro lifecycle soak.
>
> **What is implemented is not what is verified, and the difference is the whole point of
> `docs/STATUS.md`.** Read it before believing any milestone word above: it names, per dated run,
> which gates were green on which commit. P4's detailed-engine calibration gate is still open,
> persistence productionization (history compaction against the 8 MB save ceiling) is open under M9,
> and per-milestone exclusions are recorded there rather than here.
>
> The rejected v2, Stitch and 34-screen Film Room references were removed on 2026-08-11. The
> corrected canonical language is **The Coach's World**, with Film Room reserved for scouting,
> tactics and replay. [`docs/04-UX-AND-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`](docs/04-UX-AND-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md) owns the
> complete 62-family screen inventory and the three-proof gate. Reference HTML never becomes
> production SwiftUI.
>
> [`docs/STATUS.md`](docs/STATUS.md) is the honest picture and takes precedence over this
> paragraph, and it is also the cold-start pointer: the older `docs/HANDOFF-2026-08-10.md` was
> deleted on the manifest's record for sending a cold builder into an obsolete phase sequence.

## Start here

1. **[`docs/DOC-MANIFEST.md`](docs/DOC-MANIFEST.md)** — what is canon, and what was deleted and why.
   Read this before opening anything else in `docs/`. Its rule has two limbs, and quoting only the
   first inverts it: a document carries authority if it is marked `RETAINED` **or** is one of the
   canon documents listed in its §4. Anything else carries none, whatever path it sits at.
2. **[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)** — standing rules for every session: process, tech stack, conventions,
   the legal guardrail.
3. **[`docs/reviews/2026-08-09-spec-prompt-v4.md`](docs/reviews/2026-08-09-spec-prompt-v4.md)** — the
   governing brief. Owner parameters, authority tiers, the core design problem, the deliverable list.
   Where any other document disagrees with it, the other document is wrong.

For a build session, **[`docs/08-OPUS5-BUILD-PROMPT.md`](docs/08-OPUS5-BUILD-PROMPT.md)** is the
entry point: it owns the mission and the definition of done, and it runs one phase at a time.

## Non-negotiables

- **The shipped universe is fictional and original.** No bundled real school, team, conference,
  player or coach names; no real logos, colours, fight songs or broadcast identities. The UI
  reserves optional person/team/venue asset slots so a future, separately approved custom-universe
  feature is not architecturally blocked. Import is not a v1 feature and requires its own legal,
  privacy, security and content-handling decision. Name-collision and trade-dress tests remain gates
  on the bundled generator.
- **Determinism.** A given seed plus a given input state reproduces a match exactly, across processes
  and app launches. Seeds derive from identifier bytes, never from `hashValue`.
- **Offline, single-player.** No network, no accounts, no analytics, no ads, no IAP, no subscriptions.
- **iPhone-only, landscape-only, iOS 26+, tested on iPhone 15-generation hardware and newer, zero
  third-party app dependencies.** The 2D match view renders
  in SwiftUI `Canvas` + `TimelineView` — no SpriteKit, no Metal.
- **A full season is completable in 6–8 hours of play.**

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `docs/` | Design and planning documents. Start at `docs/DOC-MANIFEST.md` |
| *(no archive)* | Deleted 2026-08-10. See `docs/DOC-MANIFEST.md` |
| `docs/plans/` | Per-phase task plans, one per phase, written before that phase is built |
| `docs/04-UX-AND-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` | The Coach's World language, canonical 62-family screen inventory and proof gate |
| `docs/reviews/` | The governing brief and the review that produced it |
| `docs/roadmap/` | The Master Build Documentation and the M0–M9 milestone gates |
| `Sources/FootballSimCore/` | The engine — pure Swift, no UI imports, seeded RNG |
| `Sources/ProFootballCoachUI/` | The SwiftUI layer: views, design tokens, screen registry, packaged team marks |
| `Sources/CoachWorldApp/` | The composition layer — the only module allowed to see both `GameState` and the screen read models, plus the save store |
| `Tests/SimTests/` | The suite and its hand-rolled harness |
| `Tests/ProFootballCoachTests/`, `Tests/ProFootballCoachUITests/` | The two XCTest bundles the Xcode project builds; not part of the SwiftPM package |
| `App/` | Thin `@main` iOS shell + `project.yml` for Xcode project generation |
| `Tools/` | Development tooling: the surface-reference renderer and the team-mark pipeline. Never linked into the app |
| `output/`, `exports/`, `artifacts/` | Working output of the team-mark pipeline and its reviews. Not shipped; the packaged marks live in `Sources/ProFootballCoachUI/Resources/` |
| `scripts/verify.sh` | Runs the machine gates and prints a pasteable result |

The previous build was removed by P0; what is under `Sources/`, `Tests/` and `App/` now is the
rebuild. `docs/PORT-LOG.md` records what survived and why, both ways.

## Building

```bash
./scripts/verify.sh
```

That is the gate: the release build, then the full suite. Pass `--build` for the build alone.

Longer gates run as **named lanes**, each with its own scratch directory and logs so a failed
calibration or archive run cannot contaminate another: `--lane core`, `determinism`, `calibration`,
`soaks`, `accessibility`, `archive`, `release`, and `app` (XcodeGen + a generic iOS build).

```bash
./scripts/verify.sh --lane core
```

Both library targets — engine *and* SwiftUI — build for macOS as well as iOS, so the codebase is
compile-verified from the command line without full Xcode. Neither XCTest nor swift-testing ships
with the Swift Command Line Tools, so the suite is an **executable target** with a hand-rolled
harness (`Tests/SimTests/TestKit.swift`); it reports real pass/fail counts and exits non-zero on
failure. The commands underneath are:

```bash
swift build -c release -Xswiftc -enable-testing && swift run -c release -Xswiftc -enable-testing SimTests
```

`-Xswiftc -enable-testing` is not optional. `SimTests` is a plain executable target that `@testable
import`s `ProFootballCoachUI`, and SwiftPM has no reason to infer testability for one — so a release
run without the flag fails every target that `@testable` imports anything, with "module ... was not
compiled for testing". `verify.sh` passes it for you.

A run is only complete if it ends with TestKit's `N tests, M checks` summary line. A `precondition`
failure is a SIGTRAP: it kills the process mid-run, and every suite after it silently never runs.
`verify.sh` fails a lane that ends without that line; a hand-run command needs the same check.

To build and run the iOS app you need full Xcode and
[XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (a build-time tool, not an app dependency). The
project is written next to its spec, in `App/`:

```bash
xcodegen generate --spec App/project.yml && open App/ProFootballCoach.xcodeproj
```

If `xcodebuild` reports no simulator destinations, the iOS platform component is missing:
`xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS` installs it.

**On claiming a green build.** Agent environments frequently have no `swift` and no `xcodebuild`.
Where the toolchain is absent, code is written to the same standard and recorded in
`docs/STATUS.md` as **unverified — never compiled**, naming the files. Nothing is reported as "build
green" or "tests pass" that a compiler has not seen in the session making the claim.
