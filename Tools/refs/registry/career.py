"""Career -- nine canonical surfaces plus the five missing screens and three overlays the
source assigns to this family.

Four of the nine are wrappers into `CareerHubView` or `LegacyHistoryView`. Legacy History
is the sharpest case: four concepts in 175 lines with two record kinds supplied, so Record
Book, Rivalries, Career Line and Coaching Tree are one screen.

The overlays carry no `CoachWorldScreenID` at all -- they render over any surface, which is
why the registry never caught their absence. The family assignment below is an artefact of
a registry that only models screens, and each one declares that as a gap."""
