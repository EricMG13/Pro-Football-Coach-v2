# Claude build handoff

## Latest handoff — eight red suites on main, seven of them a merge (2026-08-22)

`main` at `da0eb73` failed eight suites in CI run `32558005794`. Seven of the eight were the shape
of a merge rather than a defect: PR #69 resolved file by file and kept one branch's tests beside
the other branch's production code. `docs/STATUS.md`'s 2026-08-22 entry carries the full account
and is the record to read; this is the pointer to it.

What was done, in order:

1. Merged the nine unmerged commits on `agent/floodlit-injury-evidence` (`c42b6e4`…`3a35bc6`).
   They restore `DetailedGameSummaryBuilder`'s preserved losses and re-derive ten fingerprints, and
   they close `Legal: shipped copy`, `League generation`, `Game loop` and `Authoritative game state`.
2. Reconciled four assertions that could not hold together after the merge — the pre-kickoff
   comparison root in `M4 tactical state`, the appended professional seat in `M5 career arc`, and
   the week-20 terminal checkpoint and NIL-budget fixture in `College portal scheduler lifecycle`.
3. Raised `SharedRules.minimumPlayableRosterByPosition[.runningBack]` to 2, for the reserve back
   `DepthChart.offensiveTemplate` now fields. This was a new failure the merge created, caught by
   the existing cross-check in `RulesTests`; no determinism lane moved with it.

### Closed 2026-08-24 — the band holds, and the cause was an intake that invented players

`46b96bb8` offers a seat vacated by retirement to the professionals the league already has before
generating one. The past-decline share reads **0.228, 0.196, 0.183, 0.203, 0.218** at seasons 0, 1,
3, 6 and 10, against 0.228, 0.196, 0.134, **0.067**, 0.162 before; mean age holds at 27.07, 26.81,
26.56, 26.80, 26.70 instead of sagging to 25.59. `--people-lifecycle` passes at 24 tests / 520,238
checks, `--architecture-only` at 29 / 245 with no pin moved. No band was widened and no retirement
constant moved. Everything below is the investigation that got there, kept because four of its
findings are things not to retry.

### What it was, and must not be re-pinned

`Lifecycle distributions hold their bands`. The professional past-decline share reads 0.228, 0.196,
0.146, **0.073**, 0.170 at seasons 0, 1, 3, 6, 10 against a band of 0.08…0.30. It is a real
measurement of two things at once: active professional rosters hold 1,411…1,533 against 32 × 53 =
1,696 from the first offseason onward, and every professional enters at age 22, so the initial
veteran tail retires out before the drafted cohorts reach decline. `--pro-soak` already asserts the
roster-legality half and is already red for it.

**Do not widen the band.** `--pro-movement-probe` found three things. One is not a defect, one is
fixed, and one is open.

**Not a defect — read the probe's season labels.** Its window labelled "season 1" is the weeks of
season 0, when the market is legitimately closed; it opens at the season-0 boundary. "Free agency
never ran" there is correct. An earlier revision of this file called that the bug. It is not.

**Fixed, 2026-08-23 — the draft could not finish.** Expiry leaves clubs six to seventeen seats short
against seven rounds, so the club that lost fewest filled up on its own sixth pick, and
`makeDraftPicks` treated the `activeRosterFull` as fatal: one full club ended the round for the
other thirty-one, and the next week resumed at the same stuck pick. The market never reached
`.rosterBuild` in any season and the draft made 130 of 224 picks by season four. A pick a club
cannot seat is now passed (`02` section 4.2), leaving the prospect on the board for the club behind
it. Picks landed went 220→223, 197→218, 130→189, 135→165 across seasons 2 to 5, active rosters
1,436→1,439, 1,474→1,496, 1,456→1,526 and 1,271→1,341, and the weeks stuck in `.draft` 16→1.

**The draft fix did not close the band, and nudged it the other way.** After it, the past-decline
share reads 0.228, 0.196, 0.134, **0.067**, 0.161 against 0.228, 0.196, 0.146, 0.073, 0.170 before.
Every figure fell, which is the expected direction: the extra picks are all age-22 intake. It rules
the draft out as the band's cause and points squarely at the two items below.

**Free agency's throughput is not a defect (2026-08-23).** With the draft finishing, the boundary
count is exactly `1,696 - expiries` every season and a week-12 sample reads 1,696 in every season.
The league is fully seated all year and short only in the instant between expiry and the market
reopening. An earlier revision of this file said otherwise; with the draft stuck that was true.

**The band is not a sampling artefact — tested 2026-08-23, do not retry this.** The league is fully
seated mid-season (1,696) and short only at the boundary the band samples (1,411…1,496), so the
age-curve sample was moved in-season and measured. It came back 0.228, 0.228, 0.149, **0.056**,
0.147 against 0.228, 0.196, 0.134, 0.067, 0.161 at the boundary — season 6 *worse*, because a full roster carries
the 223 rookies the draft has just seated. Reverted. The model does not retain enough post-decline
professionals on any sample point.

**The pool fix did not move the age band — measured 2026-08-23, do not re-suspect it.** The
figures above were recorded at `c5b9251` (03:20), and the pool fix `a86de6e` landed at 09:27, so
every number in this file predated it and rating-cut pooling was a live suspect: a post-decline
professional is by construction lower-rated than a 22-year-old intake, so cutting a 512-deep pool
by rating is exactly the shape that would exclude the players this band counts. Re-run in release
at seed 84,010 on the merged tree, the share reads **0.228, 0.196, 0.134, 0.067, 0.162** with means
27.07, 26.81, 25.79, 25.59, 25.93 over n = 1696, 1411, 1475, 1459, 1471. Identical to three
decimals except season 10, which moved 0.161 → 0.162. Ranking the pool by rating does not move the
age curve, and `signFreeAgents` never reads age at all.

**The mechanism, stated by construction rather than by sampling.** Professional intake has exactly
two sites — `ProMarketSystem.makeDraftClass` and `SeasonLifecycleSystem`'s departure backfill — and
both go through `RosterPopulationGenerator.replacement`, where

    let age = tier == .college ? 18 : 22 + ordinal % 2

The draft class is **synthesised, not promoted from the college world**, so no college player's age
ever reaches the professional tier. Against `SharedRules.declineAgeByPosition` — running back 27,
corner/receiver/edge 29, safety/linebacker/tackle/tight end 30, line 31, quarterback 34, kicker and
punter 36 — nothing that enters can reach decline for five to twelve years, while the bootstrap's
post-decline players decay at `retirementProbabilityPerYearAfterDecline` = 0.14 a year. The trough
is that gap, and season 10's recovery is the first drafted cohorts ageing into it. `5db6c8cd`
already tried to damp this with `ordinal % 2`; one year of spread against a five-to-twelve-year gap
is not damping, and it was already in place when every figure above was measured.

**Measured 2026-08-24 — the band's cause is the draft reserve, and it is arithmetic.**
`--pro-movement-probe` reports `expired=257 returned=2` in season 2 and `expired=200 returned=2` in
season 3. **Two players a season return to a professional roster, league-wide**; every other vacated
seat is filled by a 22-year-old draftee (`drafted=223`, `218`) or by a move between clubs
(`relocated=68`, `37`). That is the whole of "the model does not retain enough post-decline
professionals", and the arithmetic behind it is exact:

* `signFreeAgents` computes `signingLimit = ProRules.activeRosterLimit - remainingPicks`, which at
  the start of an offseason is `53 - 7 = 46`;
* the probe measures clubs `shortBy min=6 max=10` after expiry, so rosters sit at 43…47;
* a club therefore signs only while `roster < 46` — only if it is **eight or more short**. Most are
  six or seven short and can sign nobody at all;
* league-wide the reserve is `32 * 7 = 224` seats against 200…257 vacancies, so the reserve alone
  exceeds the whole free-agent opportunity before a single signing is attempted.

The league is refreshed roughly ninety per cent by rookies every year, which is why the past-decline
share must collapse until the drafted cohorts age in.

This refines rather than contradicts the throughput entry above: that one measured **seat counts**,
and the league genuinely is fully seated mid-season. On **who fills the seats**, throughput is two
a season.

**The fix has a canon dependency, so it is not made here.** The reserve exists because
`makeDraftPicks` once treated a full roster as fatal — one full club ended the round for the other
thirty-one. `a86de6e` changed an unseatable pick to pass instead. The two mechanisms are now
redundant, and together they starve free agency; shrinking the reserve is the change. But `02`
section 4.2 is cited at that line, and the doc-first rule says canon answers a gameplay question
before code does. **What canon has to decide is how many seats a club reserves for picks it has not
yet made, now that a pick it cannot seat is passed rather than fatal.**

**The obvious fix is the wrong one, and that is the owner's decision.** Season 0 draws ages from
`min(34, max(22, gaussian(mean: 27, sd: 3)))` — a different distribution from the one the process
sustains, which is what 0.228 at season 0 against 0.162 at season 10 says. Re-seeding season 0 from
the process would remove the transient and hold the band at every sample point. It would also be
fitting the model to the test: 0.16 is low for the sport and 0.228 is the closer figure, so that
change buys a green suite by making the league permanently too young. **The gap belongs to
retention — how long a post-decline professional stays in the league — not to the seed
distribution**, and moving `retirementProbabilityPerYearAfterDecline`, the post-decline rating
decay, or a club's willingness to re-sign a veteran are three different design answers with three
different consequences for the game. That is the decision `docs/STATUS.md` asks for, and it is
still open.

**The free-agent pool picked its members by coin toss — fixed 2026-08-23.** `openOffseason` capped
the pool at `maximumFreeAgentIDs` (512) with `sorted { $0.uuidString < ... }.prefix(512)`, so once
the unattached population passed 512 it kept the same arbitrary slice every season and everyone else
was unsignable for the rest of the save. Cut by rating now, ties on identifier, same bound.

Checkpoint: **M7 is complete except conference realignment.** Continue from here; do not redo the
green gates below.

**`docs/STATUS.md` is the truth.** This file is a pointer, not a substitute — the previous version of
it listed only focused gates and a reader reasonably took that as "the build is green". It was not:
the full suite was red. Read STATUS before believing any summary, including this one.

## Verified, on 2026-08-12

`./scripts/verify.sh` — **663 tests / 747,584 checks, exit 0**, debug build and release suite. This
is the whole default run, not a selection.

Focused gates, each measured rather than estimated:

- `--core-contracts` 152 / 980
- `--news-feed` 8 / 14
- `--programme-evolution` 7 / 275
- `--architecture-only` 25 / 222
- `--generation-only` 34 / 39,143
- `--legal-only` 22 / 141
- `--history-archive` 20 / 147
- `--coaching-tree` 11 / 25
- `--rivalry-order` 7 / 11
- `--portal-scheduler` 9 / 27,823 (two-season byte-identical replay)
- `--m7-gate` 1 / 65, in release, 30 seasons

Root schema is **11**.

## What this checkpoint added

- **M7A** — rival lists reorder from the intensity their meetings earned, through the same ranking
  that seeded them; `CoachingTreeReadModel` derives mentor-to-disciple from bounded staff careers,
  rebuilt rather than persisted.
- **M7B** — the historical aggregate archive. An event leaving the bounded hot journal folds into a
  `SeasonHistoryDigest` for its own season: an archived count plus a bounded, *ranked* sample of
  bodies. `digest(forSeason:)` surfaces a past season without reading the journal or the save.
- **Save compression** — `03b` §4's reserved flags bit, claimed. **306.9 MB → 36.0 MB at season 30**,
  8.5x, with season 1 inside the original 8 MB ceiling.
- **The legal guardrail now refuses by name-kind**, after the owner permitted real locations.
- **M7C, the news feed** — headlines rendered from typed payloads over the hot journal *and* the
  archive's retained bodies, ranked by the same `historicalWeight` that decides what an archived
  season keeps. Derived, never persisted. `02` §4.2b.
- **M7D, programme evolution** — prestige was frozen at generation and now steps one point a season
  toward a target set by the final table. `02` §8. The portal characterization moved with it
  (385/210/94 entrant windows, transfers, returns became 409/217/112), which is the world evolving
  rather than a regression: those are descriptive outputs, not pins.
- **The personnel UI slice** with four proofs recaptured from current source.

## Red on purpose — read these before touching the professional tier

Neither is in the default run, so `verify.sh` is unaffected. Both name a real defect.

- **`--pro-soak`** — the both-tier professional soak the last handoff listed as open. It had never
  been written. It asserts cap and roster legality per season for all 32 teams and a byte-identical
  replay, and it fails because **the professional tier is inert**: rosters bootstrap at 53/53 and
  never turn over, and no professional holds a contract, so nothing expires and nobody reaches free
  agency. The 224-prospect draft class generated every season can never be taken.
- **`--pro-draft-probe`** — reaches the draft directly and reports the thrown reason in seconds
  rather than twelve minutes.
- **`--pro-week-walk`** — bisector: reports the exact week a professional step refuses.

**The blocker is FSC-013, not a missing cut policy.** Giving bootstrap professionals contracts was
tried and reverted. It works in isolation — 317 expire, cap legal, first draft pick succeeds — and
fails in the scheduler at season 0 week 21, because whole-root integrity validates recorded game
participants against *current* rosters. Releasing 315 players while that season's results are live
invalidates every game they played in. FSC-013 named its own activation trigger as "no later than
professional trades"; the real trigger is earlier — contract expiry at the final week of a live
season — and the entry now says so. **Professional turnover needs dated roster-tenure history
first.**

The headless offseason driver is already built and waiting for it: `ProRosterAISystem` signs while
signings are legal, begins the draft when a pass signs nobody, and picks in draft order, pausing only
when the controlled professional team is on the clock (`02` §4.2, amended 2026-08-12).

## Next work

1. **Conference realignment — M7's last item.** `02` §8 already specifies the inputs: performance,
   market and geography. It is not blocked on a decision; it is **milestone-sized**, because it
   changes league *topology* and schedule generation, standings, tiebreaks and whole-root integrity
   all read that topology. Budget it as a slice with its own plan, not as a rule.
2. **Cross-season semantic narrative** — a story that spans seasons rather than reporting one event.
   The feed reports; nothing yet narrates.
3. **M8 production UI** — gated. Its entry gate needs Coaching HQ, Recruiting Board and Match Day
   approved together as interactive native-size proofs at 31/40 or better against `04b`. A second
   session owns the design work.
4. **FSC-013 dated roster-tenure history** — unblocks the professional tier.
5. **L-01 — run the suite against the near-miss name list, and re-pin.** The blocklist work on
   `claude/game-name-equivalents-qczn9r` (PR #9) was written with no toolchain and is unverified.
   The nickname pools lost eight real college nicknames to one-for-one replacements, so
   `ArchitectureTests`' `pinnedRootFingerprint` and `pinnedAdvancedRootFingerprint` should both move
   and need re-pinning — **and a pin that does not move is the finding**, because it would mean the
   fingerprint never covered generated names. `docs/05-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`'s 2026-08-13
   amendments carry L-01 to L-06; L-02, the nickname morpheme grammar, is the only other one that is
   build work rather than a counsel or review action.
6. **M9** — where `docs/roadmap/06` puts final calibration, save migrations, performance and the long
   soak. **P4's match calibration is still failing at 5–6 of 24 bands**, and STATUS is explicit that
   the gap is model thinness — no per-drive accounting, a thin run game — not constants, so more
   search over the existing six will not move it.

## Standing constraints

Swift 5 language mode and TestKit. Preserve the actor-owned `CareerSession`, sealed portal
transactions, copied-root validation, deterministic event ordering, and no SwiftUI access to
`GameState`.

**Two things that cost real time here.** A second session commits to this branch: stage by explicit
path, never `git add -A`, and if its uncommitted work does not compile, build in a worktree rather
than touching its files. And **run the full suite before claiming green** — focused gates missed a
determinism pin that hashed the save envelope, so compression silently moved it; the full run is what
caught it.
