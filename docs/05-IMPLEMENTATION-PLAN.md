Phased build with per-phase gates. One phase at a time; a phase is not done until its gates are
green.

The platform baseline changed by owner decision on 2026-08-11: iOS 26+, with release support and
performance measured on iPhone 15-generation hardware and newer. The 844 × 390 layout floor remains
because later compact `e` models are smaller than the base iPhone 15. See
`docs/plans/2026-08-11-skill-integration.md` for the development-skill activation gates and the
scheduled creation of project-local skills.

**Ordering follows D14: college first, at ~134 programmes.** The player starts in college, and both
unsolved risks — D3/D4's scale problem and D6's identity problem — live there. Building pro first
defers both to the end of the schedule, which under P5 is how they end up unsolved.

## Gate definitions

Every phase gates on **G1–G4**. Engine phases add **G5–G7**. Milestones add **G8**.

| Gate | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **G1 Build green** | `./scripts/verify.sh --build` clean. Asserted only by having run it in the session that claims it — see the D11 note below. |
| **G2 Tests green** | `./scripts/verify.sh` passes in full — the build, then the whole suite, ending in TestKit's `N tests, M checks` summary. A run that stops short of that line is a truncated run, not a red one, and is not evidence either way. Same rule: run it, or do not claim it. Run by hand it is `swift run -c release -Xswiftc -enable-testing SimTests`; the flag is not optional (`03b` §5). |
| **G3 Surface audit** | Touched surfaces score **≥31/40 with zero P0/P1** against `docs/04b-AUDIT-RUBRIC.md` — its eight dimensions at 0–5 each, owner-approved 2026-08-11. The older ≥17/20 five-dimension frame (Accessibility, Performance, Appearance & Theming) is superseded and the bars are not equivalent. |
| **G4 Scope** | The diff contains what the phase specifies and nothing else. No opportunistic refactors. |
| **G5 Calibration** | All bands in `03` §5 hold under TOST. |
| **G6 Determinism** | Same seed reproduces exactly, **across processes**; **both** determinism source scans pass — no `hashValue`, and no ambient `UUID()`/`Date()` (`03` §3.5). |
| **G7 Soak** | The 20-season soak passes every assertion in `03` §6 **that the phase's scope can reach** — see the note below. |
| **G8 Milestone audit** | The whole app scores **≥31/40 with zero P0/P1** against `04b`'s eight dimensions, with the world-scope dimensions (4 world identity and continuity, 8 craft and resilience) judged across screen families rather than one surface. |

**Legal gates run on every phase that touches generation:** the name-collision test and the
trade-dress ΔE test.

### G7 is tier-scoped, because the unscoped version is impossible in order

Corrected 2026-08-09. `03` §6 defines the soak across **both** tiers — it asserts cap legality for
every pro team *and* scholarship legality for every college programme. P7 builds college systems and
P8 builds the cap. So a P7 that gates on the unscoped soak gates on assertions about systems that do
not exist yet, and can never go green.

G7 therefore means **the soak at the scope the phase has built**:

| Phase | G7 means |
|---|---|
| P7 | 20 seasons, college only. Scholarship, eligibility, roster, ratings, churn, save size. |
| P8 | 20 seasons, both tiers. The cap assertions come live here. |
| P9 | 20 seasons, both tiers, plus the career and carousel invariants the phase adds. |
| P16 | The full soak at full scale, every assertion in `03` §6, no exclusions. **This is the one that counts.** |

A phase that skips an assertion must name it in `docs/STATUS.md` and name the phase that turns it on.
A silently narrowed soak is the coverage-boundary failure `CLAUDE.md` warns about, wearing a gate's
clothes.

*Found by a cold-reader grill on the parallel `rebuild/spec-package` branch, which hit the identical
defect in that branch's plan — "the soak needs systems from P3 and P8". The shape transfers.*

### D11, where it bites — **resolved 2026-08-09, conditionally**

`docs/OPEN-DECISIONS.md` **D11 is closed.** The gates were run: Swift 6.3.3 and Xcode 26.6 are
present on the machine hosting these sessions, `./scripts/verify.sh` returns a green build and
`299 tests, 18412 checks, all passed`. **G1 and G2 are agent-assertable.**

Three rules survive the closure, and they are the ones that matter:

- **Run it, or do not claim it.** G1/G2 are asserted by the session that ran them, with the command
  output in hand. Citing D11, this plan, or a previous session's green run is not an assertion.
- **If the session has no toolchain, the old rules apply unchanged.** A sandboxed agent container has
  no `swift`. An agent that writes code without a compiler records it in `docs/STATUS.md` as
  **unverified — never compiled**, naming the files, and does not claim the phase is done. A phase
  whose only outstanding gates are G1/G2 is then blocked on the owner, not complete.
- **An adversarial review is not a build** and must never be reported as one.

Phase 4C of the previous build shipped never having been compiled. The toolchain being present now
removes the excuse, not the failure mode.

---

## Phases

### P0 — Foundation
Module skeleton per `03b` §1; the ported `SeededRandom` and `CodingSupport` plus the hierarchical
seed derivation contract from `03` §3; the **four** source-scanning tests (no SwiftUI in the engine,
no `hashValue` in seeding, no ambient `UUID()`/`Date()` in the engine, no design-token literals in
views), each comment-stripping and each with a self-test that fails on a planted offender, gathered
into one contract suite; the save
envelope with a version readable without a full parse; the ported `TestKit` harness; and the removal
of everything in `Sources/` not named in `docs/PORT-LOG.md`, in one legible commit.
**Gates:** G1, G2, G4, G6.

**Not blocked.** D11 is closed in both halves — the ported harness runs the tests, and the session
runs the harness. P0 asserts all four of its gates for real.

P0 carries one baseline obligation the other phases do not: the suite is green today at **299 tests,
18,412 checks** against the *previous* build. P0 deletes most of what those cover. The phase must
therefore state, at its close, the new count and what was removed — a suite that shrinks silently is
how a coverage boundary becomes a quality boundary, which is the failure `CLAUDE.md` names.

### P1 — Model and rules
Player, contract, programme, team, staff, league. Both rules modules — every constant that `02` and
`03` name, none inline.
**Gates:** G1, G2, G4.

### P2 — Generation and identity (D6)
Map and regions; 14 programme archetypes; name banks; tradition grammar with mechanical hooks;
rivalry seeding; team colour generation that must pass contrast and trade-dress at generation time.
**Gates:** G1, G2, G4, **both legal tests**, `IdentityDistributionTests`.

### P3 — Match engine core (D2)
Assignment → leverage → resolution → consequence. Clock and situation per tier, including the college
clock rules. Drive and game loops.
**Gates:** G1, G2, G4, G6.

### P4 — Calibration harness and bands
The harness, TOST, and the band set. Pro bands first — they start from the numbers already asserted
in the prior suite and are the known-good target — then college bands from §6.4.
**Gates:** G1, G2, G4, G5, G6.

### P5 — Abstracted model and two-tier consistency (D3, D4)
The off-screen model; `TwoTierConsistencyTests` under TOST; week-advance performance at ~134
programmes including recruiting AI cost.
**Gates:** G1, G2, G4, G5, G6, plus `PerformanceBudgetTests`.
**This is the phase that tests D14's fallback.** If the 2.0 s ceiling cannot be met at 134, reduce
the programme count here — before anything is tuned around it — rather than loosening the ceiling.

**`PerformanceBudgetTests` must assert only in release, and must measure in both.** `03` §7's budgets
assume an optimised build. A perf gate that asserts under `-Onone` reports a meaningless failure —
and, worse, would report a meaningless *pass* if the budget were ever loosened to accommodate it. The
prior build learned this concretely: its week-advance test asserted 150 ms and measured 398 ms in
debug, with no build-configuration guard. Measure both configurations, print both, assert on release.
*(Lesson taken from `adf5af1` on the unmerged `rebuild/spec-package` branch.)*

**And the budgets are Mac numbers until a device says otherwise.** `03` §7 now requires an
iPhone 15-class device; nothing has measured them on one. A green `PerformanceBudgetTests` on an
Apple-silicon Mac is necessary and not sufficient, and `docs/STATUS.md` says so.

### P6 — Season structure
Schedule generation both tiers, standings, tiebreakers, conference championships, brackets, awards.
**Gates:** G1, G2, G4, G6.

### P7 — College systems
Recruiting (contact budget, interest model, evaluation fog), the portal, NIL, eligibility clocks,
scholarships, signing day.
**Gates:** G1, G2, G4, G6, G7.

### P8 — Pro systems
Draft with scouting fog, salary cap with proration and dead money, free agency in waves, trades,
practice squad.
**Gates:** G1, G2, G4, G6, G7.

### P9 — Career, stakes and the arc (D5, D8)
Weekly job security against expectation; four stakeholder groups with triggers; the inbox event
system; firing in-season; the carousel that cannot dead-end; the promotion arc and what carries
across.
**Gates:** G1, G2, G4, G7, `JeopardyTests`, `CareerArcTests`.

### P10 — AI quality (D10)
Coordinator AI, roster AI, opponent game-plan AI — each against its stated bar.
**Gates:** G1, G2, G4, G5, G7, plus `CoordinatorAITests`, `RosterAITests`, `AdaptationTests`.
**These bars are gates, not polish.** AI quality is what gets cut when a schedule slips, and naming
it here is the only defence P5 allows.

**The UI phases do not build against the deleted v2 sheets, Stitch output or the rejected 34-screen
Film Room gallery.** Those artefacts repeated one application chassis across the game and were
removed on 2026-08-11. `04` remains the only canonical design and screen-inventory authority.

**They build against the eight `*-v3.dc.html` sheets** — owner-approved 2026-08-12, named in
`04` §6.5, indexed with renders in `docs/proofs/design-references/`. Those are the definitive
design references for composition and states; `04` still owns every value.

Before feature SwiftUI begins, three interactive proof screens establish the corrected direction:
Coaching HQ, Recruiting Board and Match Day. **Proof medium amended 2026-08-12:** the proofs are
the native SwiftUI screens behind the DEBUG `PROOF_SCREEN` routing — the earlier "HTML proofs"
wording predates those views existing; `04` §10 owns the proof-medium rule. They share one
continuous save but use three visibly different registers. Passing the proof gate demonstrates
direction; it does not authorise invented read-model values — the proof screens are production
code paths whose read models stay fixture-provenance until G-01.

### P11 — Proof gate, design system and accessibility contract (D12)

1. Render the three owner-approved proof screens at both native sizes, both appearances, default and
   AX5, and both sensor orientations.
2. Score each at least 31/40 under `04b`, with no P0/P1 and no automatic design-specificity rejection.
3. Obtain owner approval of the set together. A mechanically passing proof that still looks like an
   application does not pass.
4. Build production tokens, shared interaction primitives and contract tests. Do not create a
   universal screen chassis or port reference HTML/CSS into SwiftUI.

The contract is built before feature views so subsequent phases inherit safe-area, type, theme,
truth, focus, motion and target guarantees. Components are promoted only after at least three real
production uses. Screen-specific football objects remain screen-specific.

### P12 — Entry, office and the playable week

Build the entry sequence, Coaching HQ, Inbox, Opponent Report / Film Room, Game Plan, Practice Plan,
Team Health and Aftermath from the named read models in `04` §8. Onboarding is state on these real
surfaces, not a separate tour.

Coaching HQ must prove the Coach's Office register rather than a dashboard: current world strip,
dominant week plan, next obligation and causal staff voice. Opponent Report is the only weekly screen
that inherits the Film Room register. A first decision that fails `02` §2.2 teaches the wrong game.
**Gates:** G1, G2, G3, G4.

### P13 — Match Day

Build the Broadcast register directly from `04` §9: complete landscape field, all 22 actors, at
most three foregrounded, scorebug, causal lower third, five primary controls and contextual staff
call-ins. Management navigation and application chrome are absent. The choreographer remains pinned
to recorded outcomes; Reduce Motion is a discrete state sequence; every snap has an equivalent
VoiceOver sentence.

**Gates:** G1, G2, G3, G4, plus the render-cannot-change-outcome assertion and the 16.7 ms frame
ceiling.
**Owner walkthrough owes an orientation read.** The landscape field rests on the `04` §5.2 arithmetic
plus a soccer precedent for a sport with the opposite field ratio, and it runs against FM's community
finding that the *vertical* pitch reads better for structure. The script must ask the owner,
explicitly, whether the field reads as a football field on a phone and whether the line of scrimmage
is legible as a line — the one presentation question no test in this plan can answer.
**→ Milestone M1: G8.**

### P14 — Remaining screen inventory

Build every remaining family in the explicit 62-screen inventory in `04` §8. Nothing may hide inside
a comma-list. Each family requires a named read model, world location, dominant football object,
state matrix and owner-visible completion gate.

Comparison tasks may be dense. They may not become generic tables: people, relationships, needs,
uncertainty and consequence remain visible. Analytical readouts state staff interpretation before
evidence and identify the sample and confidence. Career surfaces use chronology rather than summary
dashboards. Offseason command surfaces are dated sequences that open the real task screens.

**Gates:** G1, G2, G3, G4, every touched screen ≥31/40 under `04b`, and no inventory gap.

### P15 — Onboarding (D9)
The first fifteen minutes, taught through the first real week.
**Gates:** G1, G2, G3, G4, plus the D9 owner protocol.

**P15 no longer builds onboarding from nothing, and the correction matters.** D9's onboarding is
diegetic — it rides the week surfaces P12 builds and the entry sequence P12 now owns. A P15 that
arrives after P14 and starts building would be retrofitting first-run state into fourteen phases of
screens designed without it. P15's real scope is **tuning and the D9 protocol**: the beat sheet's
pacing, what is said when, and the owner run-through. The build happens in P12.

**And the owner walkthrough owes a first-hour read, not only a field read.** P13's script asks
whether the field reads as football. Nothing asked about the first hour — which `02` §9 names as the
thing that sells the game. That question belongs here.
**→ Milestone M2: G8.**

### P16 — Durability
The 20-season soak at full scale; save-size trajectory; bounded-collection growth checks; migration
fixtures at every version boundary.
**Gates:** G1, G2, G4, G5, G6, G7.

### P17 — Pre-deployment
`docs/PRE-DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md` in full.
**→ Milestone M3: G8, plus the owner simulator walkthrough.**

## What "done" means for an agent

Split, because the build environment cannot reach half of it.

**Machine-verifiable — an agent may assert these:** G1–G8 as above, the calibration bands,
cross-process determinism, the soak, the two legal tests, and the accessibility contract tests.

**Owner-verifiable — an agent hands these off and never claims them:** the simulator walkthrough
(script written by the agent, run by the owner), the D1 timing constants, the D9 onboarding protocol,
and the D6 identity protocol.

Any surface a compiler has not seen is recorded in `docs/STATUS.md` as **unverified — never
compiled**, naming the files.

---

## Road to beta — the consolidated outstanding list (appended on owner instruction, 2026-08-12)

**`docs/plans/2026-08-12-road-to-beta.md` is the single aggregated list of everything outstanding**,
ordered by what stands between the build and the owner's stated definition of complete: **a beta
test on a real iPhone.** It supersedes hunting through session transcripts, and it carries the four
items that block a device build before any feature does — chief among them that **no session has
ever compiled this as an iOS app**, only as a SwiftPM package and a headless test executable.

Read it before scheduling any phase below.

## 2026-08-12 amendments — density model and reference uplift (appended on owner instruction)

Source: the 2026-08-12 reference-uplift session. The findings live in `docs/briefs/2026-08-12-*.md`;
the gap register (`docs/briefs/2026-08-12-gap-register.md`) grounds every entry here, and `G-nn`
references resolve there. **Insertions only; nothing above is renumbered.**

**Plan authority, owner statement 2026-08-12: this file is outdated as build ordering.** The current
build plan is the Codex checkpoint handoff `docs/HANDOFF-CLAUDE.md` (M-roadmap), being executed in a
live session at the time of this append. The P-phase forms below remain the detailed record; they
bind operatively in M-vocabulary as:

- **P10b** = an M7 slice (G-02 verdicts/baselines beside the living-world work) plus the M4
  remainder (G-05 opponent knowledge) and the detailed-match attribution work (G-11).
- **P11 entry conditions** = additions to the **M8 production-UI entry gate** — the handoff's
  "M8 only after its production-UI entry gate" is the binding point: G-07 token write-back, G-08
  density budget and registry adoption, G-09 test half, G-12 AX5 instrument, G-13 failure set.
- **P13 dependency** = G-06 anchor contract lands before M8's Match Day surfaces.
- **P14 gate** = the per-family density-budget statement check applies as M8 families land.
- The owner directive below (all UI/UX to date is stale reference) governs all M8 design work.

Owner directives recorded 2026-08-12:

- **All UI and UX work to date is stale reference, not design authority.** The core build continues
  uninterrupted; P11-and-later design work follows the density model
  (`docs/briefs/2026-08-12-density-model.md`) and the reference-uplift findings once their proposed
  canon amendments are accepted or amended by the owner.
- **The density target is the desktop-class Football Manager experience adapted to iPhone**,
  replicated inside this project's fictional universe. Owner testimony 2026-08-12: the corpus is
  various FM versions, mainly desktop; the intended experience is the SKU with desktop-level
  functionality on iPhone. The capture corpus itself evidences desktop FM and not that SKU
  (`docs/briefs/2026-08-12-reference-set-findings.md` §2); the target stands on the owner's
  statement and is recorded as testimony, not capture evidence.

### Insertion: P10b — Analytics and evidence authority (between P10 and P11)

Scope: G-02 distributional baselines and engine-owned verdicts; G-03 per-player attribute-change
record; G-04 form series and the player-game rating definition; G-05 opponent-preparation knowledge
completion; G-11 detailed-match per-player stat lines. Verdict voice, owner 2026-08-12: verdicts are
attributed to **named staff** — G-02's staff-voice attribution is a requirement, and the `02`
amendment naming which judgements exist and who voices them is part of G-02's scope.

**Gates:** G1, G2, G4, G6, plus a verdict-reachability test (every verdict class producible) and the
soak growth check over the new bounds (G-02 ≤ 1.5 MB, G-03 ≤ 0.6 MB, G-04 ≤ 0.3 MB, G-05 ≤ 0.2 MB,
G-06 current game only — ≤ 2.6 MB uncompressed total).

Displaces nothing: pure insertion. It may run alongside P10 but must complete before P14's readout
families. In the milestone vocabulary `docs/STATUS.md` builds by, this is an M7 slice plus the M4
remainder.

### Amendment: P11 entry conditions

P11's existing scope is unchanged; the following are named as entry conditions it currently assumes
silently: G-07 (token write-back into `04` §6.1/§6.2 with measured ratios), G-08 (density budget and
component registry adoption in `04`), G-09's test half (`OrientationPolicyTest` written; two-tier
`SmallestDeviceLayoutTest` — install floor 844 × 390 no-clipping, promise floor full budget), G-12
(AX5 reflow contract test enumerating families from `ScreenRegistry.swift` by construction), G-13
(failure-set designs).

*Status 2026-08-12: the doc halves of G-07 and G-08 are done — `04` §6.1/§6.2 hold every shipped
value with measured ratios, §4.5 the density budget, §6.5 the component registry and the
verdict-state rule, §6.6 the symbol register. The test halves are P11a above, and they are what the
gate now waits on.*

### Amendment: P13 dependency

P13 states its dependency on G-06's anchor contract explicitly (FSC-011 already implies it; the plan
now says it).

### Amendment: P14 gate

P14's gate includes the per-family density-budget statement check from G-08.

### Insertion: P10c — Professional roster turnover (between P10b and P11)

**Unblocked and largely landed — updated 2026-08-20.** This entry was written blocked on two owner
questions, and canon `02` §4.2a answered both on 2026-08-12/13. (1) Bootstrap professionals do get
contracts, rotated through `ProRules.bootstrapContractTermSpread` terms at
`bootstrapPayrollPercentOfCap` of the cap, applied in `RosterPopulationGenerator`. (2) Cuts to 53
are forced by cap compliance at the week-21 boundary, cheapest dead money first, in
`ProManagementSystem.enforceCapCompliance` — inside the same `advanceWeek` transition that runs
beat 1's expiry, so no persisted root is ever over the cap.

*The paragraph this replaces said bootstrap "fills every professional team to exactly 53/53 and
issues no contracts". That stopped being true and the entry did not say so, which is the failure
mode `docs/STATUS.md` exists to prevent.*

Turnover is now measured rather than argued. `--pro-draft-probe` is **green** — 327 contracts expire
at the season rollover, roster seats open, and the first pick succeeds — and across ten soak seasons
1,491 contracts expire and 1,476 free agents sign.

**This entry's falsifier fired, and it was right.** It read: "if turnover lands and the draft still
cannot make a pick, the diagnosis was wrong." Turnover landed and the draft still made no pick. The
`activeRosterFull` diagnosis was right about the symptom and wrong about the cause — the cause was
not that nothing frees seats, it was that **free agency took every seat expiry freed before the
draft opened**, at every seed. `02` §4.2 had free agency sign until the pool ran dry and start the
draft on that same pass, and a dry pool is a full roster, so the draft always opened with nothing.

Free agency now reserves the seats the draft needs (`02` §4.2, owner decision 2026-08-20). Rosters
settle at 46, the draft opens with 224 seats for 224 prospects, and **both gates are green** —
`--pro-soak` records 1,557 draft picks across ten seasons where every previous run recorded zero.

**What the fix surfaced, and did not fix.** The free-agent pool now sits pinned at its 512 bound
rather than draining each season, and `openOffseason` truncates it in `uuidString` order, so which
free agents the league can see is decided by identifier rather than by rating. `02` §4.2a picked the
one-fifth term spread to leave "real headroom for carryover" and that premise no longer holds. A
larger bound, a rating-ordered pool, or retirement removing the unattached are the candidates; the
choice is an owner call. See `docs/STATUS.md`.

**Gates:** G1, G2, G4, G6, plus `--pro-soak` and `--pro-draft-probe`, both now green. Neither is in
the default run, so `verify.sh` is unaffected either way.

**Blocks:** nothing further. M6 completion, the professional draft and free agency all clear this
entry.

### Insertion: P11a — The M8 production-UI entry gate, as tests (immediately before P11)

The entry conditions named above are currently assertions in prose. This phase makes them
mechanical, and none of it touches engine work.

- **G-07 test half** — a `ContractTests` sync check so `04` §6.1/§6.2 and
  `Sources/ProFootballCoachUI/DesignTokens.swift` cannot drift. The values are written back; nothing
  stops them diverging tomorrow.
- **G-08** — the symbol-register contract test. `04` §6.6 now holds the product's whole symbol
  vocabulary in capped classes; the test walks `Sources/ProFootballCoachUI/ScreenRegistry.swift`
  **by construction** and fails when a surface draws a symbol the register does not hold, or when a
  class exceeds its cap. The coverage-boundary rule in `CLAUDE.md` forbids a hand list here: the
  reference library shipped with every sheet pricing its own spend locally and asserting global
  compliance, which no sheet could know, and the missing global check is exactly this test.
- **G-09 test half** — `OrientationPolicyTest` (reads `App/project.yml`; `CLAUDE.md` claims it
  asserts landscape-only and it does not exist) and the two-tier `SmallestDeviceLayoutTest`: every
  registry surface un-clipped and reachable at the 844 × 390 install floor, at full budget at the
  852 × 393 promise floor.
- **G-12** — the AX5 reflow contract, enumerating families from the registry, asserting no datum is
  dropped and reading order is preserved.
- **G-13** — the failure-set designs exist on `failure-v3.dc.html`; this phase carries them into the
  view layer as families land.

**Gates:** G1, G2, G4, plus each test above red-then-green against a deliberately broken fixture, so
the instrument is proven to fail before it is trusted.

**Blocks:** P11 and everything after it; M8 production UI.

### Amendment: P10b gains G-14 and G-15

Two engine gaps surfaced while drawing the reference sheets, both registered in
`docs/briefs/2026-08-12-gap-register.md` §6:

- **G-14 — engine-owned load policy.** Condition-band cut points, dose multipliers and the derived
  cost the practice ladder states. Condition is engine-owned (M2); the policy is not. The week sheet
  ships its derived-cost region omitted until this exists.
- **G-15 — partial-advance completion record.** The interrupted state's "what was preserved" line
  needs the engine to expose what committed before an interruption. Advance is atomic to the caller
  today, so the copy cannot currently be truthful.

### Recorded seam (escalated 2026-08-12, resolved same day)

This file's header deferred to a Master Build Documentation (`06-BUILD-ROADMAP-AND-GATES.md`) that
was not a path in this repository; under `docs/DOC-MANIFEST.md`'s rule a document outside the canon
paths carries no authority. Escalated as owner question Q6 in
`docs/briefs/2026-08-12-gap-register.md` §4; **resolved by owner-approved import** — the pack lives
at `docs/roadmap/` with manifest rows, and the header pointer above now resolves. These amendments
remain phrased in both vocabularies.

## 2026-08-13 amendments — the near-miss name list (appended)

Source: `docs/briefs/2026-08-13-name-equivalents.md`, and the canon it produced at `02` §11.3.5.
**Insertions only; nothing above is renumbered.** Items are numbered `L-nn` so they do not collide
with the 2026-08-12 gap register's `G-nn`.

The work these amend is on `claude/game-name-equivalents-qczn9r` (PR #9) and is **unverified — never
compiled**. `docs/STATUS.md` carries the entry. Everything below assumes it lands; L-01 is what makes
that assumption checkable.

### L-01 — compile and run the suite, and re-pin what the pool swap moved. **Blocks any later claim of green.**

The blocklist additions, the eight nickname-pool replacements and six new `LegalTests` cases were
written in an environment with no `swift` and no `xcodebuild`. The first session with a toolchain
runs `./scripts/verify.sh` **in full**, not a focused legal run — the handoff's standing constraint
already says why.

**Expect two pins to move, and treat a pin that does not move as the finding.** `ArchitectureTests`
holds `pinnedRootFingerprint` and `pinnedAdvancedRootFingerprint` as source literals over the
bootstrapped world, and that world contains generated nicknames. Seven noun swaps and one adjective
swap change those names, so both fingerprints should change and be re-pinned in the same commit that
records the new values. If either is unchanged, the fingerprint does not cover generated names and
the pin has been asserting less than it appears to — which is a defect in the pin, not a convenience.

The RNG stream itself is unchanged: the swaps are one-for-one and `rng.pick` draws the same index, so
nothing outside names should move. That is a prediction, and the run is what tests it.

**Gates:** G1, G2, G4, both legal tests, `IdentityDistributionTests`, and the two re-pins.

### L-02 — nickname morphemes, not a pool of real nouns. A P2 slice; **M1 generation** in milestone vocabulary.

The durable fix for the class L-01 cleans up by hand. Every other name in the generator is assembled
from invented morphemes precisely so that a name bank of plausible real words cannot exist; nicknames
are the one pool that is still a list of real English nouns, and eight of the forty were real college
nicknames. The blocklist caught none of them, because a denylist built from one division is silent
about every other.

Scope: a noun-and-adjective grammar in the register the pool already uses, sized so the
duplicate-nickname pressure `NameGrammar` records (22 nouns against 166 teams) gets better rather than
worse. **Gates:** G1, G2, G4, both legal tests, plus `IdentityDistributionTests` on duplicate rates,
and the by-construction morpheme check must still enumerate the whole reachable set.

Not blocked on a decision. Budget it as a slice with its own plan under `docs/plans/`.

### L-03 — blocklist provenance and register check. P17, and a counsel action.

No entry on the list has been checked against a trademark register by anyone. Three entries —
"Collegiate Athletic Association", "National Collegiate Association", "National Pro Football" — are
**not** claimed to be registrations at all; they are near-miss coinages, and the source says so. The
pre-deployment pass labels each entry's basis or the list keeps asserting more than it knows.

### L-04 — the title question. Owner and counsel, before any store listing.

"Pro Football Coach" sits close to the Achi Jones "Football Coach" lineage that `01` §B is built on,
and pairs "Pro Football" with a coaching sim. A working title cannot be blocklisted, so this is the
one item here that no test can carry. Raise it before P17's store-listing review, not during it.

### L-05 — the joint-identification review, as a written protocol. P17.

The one limb of the guardrail that is not a test and never will be: a fictional programme in a real
city wearing that city's real programme's colours can identify the real one although every part is
individually clean. `CLAUDE.md`, `01` §7 and `02` §11.3.5 all record it as a review obligation, and
none of them says *how* the review is run. P17 needs a protocol — what is sampled, by whom, against
what — or the obligation is prose that has never been performed.

### L-06 — trade-dress maintenance. P17.

71 hand-maintained pairs against a sport with thousands of programmes, now covering both tiers. The
refresh item exists in the checklist; what does not exist is a statement of what the list is *for* —
which programmes are in scope and why that is the right boundary — so a future refresh has something
to be complete against.

### Amendment: P2's legal gate, and P17's

P2's **both legal tests** gate is unchanged in name and larger in content: it now includes the
near-miss cases, the numeral-form derivation over every entry, the trophy shape, the pool-purity
check, and the counterweight test that the sport's own vocabulary stays sayable.
`docs/PRE-DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md` §2 gained three items on the same date — refresh every limb, check
each mark in each written form, and check that no generator pool word is itself a real name.
