# 03 — Match Engine

D2, D3 and D4 in implementable detail. A builder should be able to work from this document without
further design work; where that is not yet true, the gap is named as such.

The engine is pure Swift with **zero `import SwiftUI`**. It runs headless, and every number below
lives in a rules module rather than inline.

---

## 1. Play resolution (D2)

### 1.1 The model

A snap resolves as a set of **matchups**, scored from ratings, and combined into an outcome. No
continuous physics, no tick integration. This is the hybrid assignment/leverage model D2 chose:
per-matchup causality the UI can narrate, with the probability mass in one place where it can be
calibrated.

```
resolveSnap(offense, defense, call, situation, rng) -> SnapOutcome
```

Stages, in fixed order (the order is part of the determinism contract):

1. **Assignment.** The offensive call assigns every offensive player a role (blocker, route runner,
   carrier, decoy). The defensive call assigns coverage responsibility, rush lanes and run fits.
2. **Leverage.** Each matchup produces a scalar in [-1, 1]:
   `leverage = f(attackerRating, defenderRating, schemeFit, fatigue, situationModifier) + noise(rng)`
   The rating term uses a logistic on the difference, not a linear one, so a 10-point gap matters
   more in the middle of the scale than at the ends.
3. **Resolution.** Leverages combine per play type into an outcome:
   - **Pass:** protection duels resolve first, producing time-to-pressure. Route matchups resolve
     into an openness score per receiver. The passer selects a target from openness, progression
     order and decision rating, then the throw resolves against openness, accuracy and pressure.
   - **Run:** front matchups resolve into lane quality; the carrier's vision and elusiveness resolve
     against pursuit leverage into yards, with a break-tackle chain that can extend the play.
   - **Kick:** distance, angle, leg strength, snap and hold quality, weather.
4. **Consequence.** Yards, clock, turnover, penalty, injury, fatigue accumulation.

### 1.2 Attribute → outcome mapping

Each matchup names the attributes it reads. This table is the contract between the ratings model in
`02` and the engine:

| Matchup | Attacker attributes | Defender attributes |
|---|---|---|
| Pass protection | run/pass block, strength, awareness | pass rush, finesse, power, motor |
| Route vs coverage | route running, speed, release, hands | coverage, speed, agility, awareness |
| Throw | accuracy (short/mid/deep), arm strength, decision, poise | (openness, pressure state) |
| Run lane | run block, strength, scheme fit | run defence, shed, gap discipline |
| Carrier vs pursuit | vision, elusiveness, power, speed | tackling, pursuit angle, speed |
| Kick | leg strength, accuracy | block leverage |

### 1.3 Ceilings

The engine owns every probability. The match view measures and dramatises; it can never change an
outcome. A test asserts that rendering a play cannot alter its recorded result — the prior build's
"one engine, one truth" invariant, worth keeping.

---

## 2. Clock and situation

- Quarters, play clock, game clock, timeouts, two-minute handling, overtime per tier rules.
- **College clock rules differ from pro and must be modelled per tier** — the current rule on the
  clock stopping for first downs is a tier constant, not a shared one. Higher college tempo is a
  consequence of the clock model, not a fudge factor applied afterwards.
- Situation is a value type carried into resolution: down, distance, field position, score
  differential, time remaining, timeouts. Every call-in trigger in `02` reads it.

---

## 3. Determinism and the seeding contract

Non-negotiable (Tier A):

1. A given seed plus a given input state reproduces a match exactly, **across processes and app
   launches**.
2. **Seeds derive from identifier bytes, never from `hashValue`.** Swift salts `hashValue` per
   launch. The prior build seeded free-agent bidding from `UUID.hashValue`, so one save produced a
   different league every app start, and no in-process test could see it.
3. A **source-scanning test** fails the build if `hashValue` appears in any seeding path.
4. RNG is a value type, passed explicitly. No global or ambient randomness anywhere in the engine.
5. **No ambient `UUID()` or `Date()` in the engine.** Identities come from `rng.uuid()`, off the
   seeded stream; time comes from the simulated calendar. A second source-scanning test enforces it.
6. Seed derivation is hierarchical and stable: `leagueSeed -> seasonSeed -> weekSeed -> gameSeed ->
   driveSeed -> snapSeed`, each derived by a documented mixing function over the parent seed and the
   identifier bytes.

**Tests:** same seed twice in-process; same seed across two separate process invocations, compared
by hash of the full play-by-play; both source scans.

### Why clause 5 is here, and what it costs to omit

Added 2026-08-09. Clause 4 already forbade ambient randomness, but nothing enforced it, and clause 3
looks for the wrong thing — the previous build's determinism leak was **not** a `hashValue`. It was
`GameSimulator.swift:884` minting `PlayEvent(id: UUID(), ...)` at a call site, plus default-valued
`id: UUID = UUID()` on four engine initialisers. Five real offenders, and the suite was green,
because the scanner never looked for `UUID()` at all. The determinism tests could not see it either:
they compare scores and stats, not identities.

**The scan's rule, stated precisely so it is implementable:**

- **Forbidden in `Engine/`, `Generation/`, `AI/` and `Abstracted/`:** `UUID()` or `Date()` as an
  argument or an assignment. Every construction site passes an identity from the seeded stream.
- **Permitted in `Model/`:** `id: UUID = UUID()` as a *default parameter value* on an initialiser. A
  source scan cannot distinguish a default from a call, and the prior build's own evidence is that
  twelve of thirteen such sites were legitimate. The guarantee is upheld on the other side instead —
  engine construction passes `rng.uuid()` explicitly, which is exactly what the scan checks.

**And a defect in the scanner itself, inherited if it is ported verbatim.** The prior build's scan
(`DynastyTests.swift:605`) matched `line.contains(".hashValue") && !line.contains("//")` — so **any
offending line with a trailing comment was silently exempt**. A scan must strip comments properly and
ship with a self-test that fails on a planted offender, or it is a green light rather than a gate.

*Source: a cold-reader grill run against the parallel `rebuild/spec-package` branch (commit
`81af3e2`), which found this class against that branch's spec. The finding is scope-independent, so
it is adopted here. That branch is unmerged; see `docs/DOC-MANIFEST.md`.*

---

## 4. The off-screen model (D3)

The abstracted model resolves games the player does not watch: **~15 a week in the pro league, ~65 a
week in the college league** (~134 programmes), plus recruiting and portal AI for every programme.

It resolves at **drive level**: possessions are generated from team strength conditioned on scheme
matchup, home advantage, and fatigue/injury state; each possession draws an outcome (touchdown, field
goal, punt, turnover, downs, end of half) and a yardage; per-player stat lines are then allocated
from usage shares. No play-by-play is produced or stored.

### 4.1 The consistency requirement

Binding, not an optimisation. Over a **1000-season Monte Carlo**, the two models must be
*statistically equivalent*:

- **Test: TOST (two one-sided tests), α = 0.05.** Pass iff the 90% confidence interval for the
  difference between models lies **entirely inside** the equivalence margin.
- **Margins:** points/game ±0.75 · yards/play ±0.15 · completion rate ±1.5 pp · sack rate ±0.6 pp ·
  turnover rate ±0.4 pp · win-rate-vs-rating-gap ±2 pp at every 5-point bucket.
- **Shape check:** total variation distance between the models' points-per-game histograms ≤ 0.06.

Scalar metrics use this TOST rule and its 90% confidence interval. Distributional metrics are the
explicit exception: they use canonical TVD, never a scalar margin.

**Range membership is explicitly rejected as the instrument.** A model whose true home-win rate is
0.62 passes a `0.50…0.60` range check roughly **1 run in 6** at n = 600, because the check has no
notion of sampling error and does not tighten as n grows. TOST puts the burden on the model.

---

## 5. The calibration harness

Implementable as specified. Structure:

```
CalibrationHarness
  .run(model:seasons:seed:) -> CalibrationReport
  report.assert(band:) -> pass/fail with the CI and the margin
```

Each band is `{ metric, tier, target, margin, test }`. The harness runs both models, produces
estimates with confidence intervals, and applies TOST — never a point-estimate range check.

### 5.1 Bands

Pro-tier bands **start from the numbers already asserted in the existing suite** (Tier B knowledge;
extracted in `01-RESEARCH.md` §6.4 with file and line) and are tightened by the TOST instrument
rather than re-derived. College-tier bands are the genuine gap and are sourced in §6.4.

Metrics both tiers must hold: points per game, yards per play, completion rate, sack rate, turnover
rate, explosive-play rate, field-goal accuracy by distance bucket, home advantage, fourth-quarter
scoring share, drive-outcome distribution, and target/carry distribution across the depth chart.

For two-tier consistency, points/game and yards/play use the explicit §4.1 margins in **both** tiers;
they are not composed from public calibration bands. FG accuracy is pooled-attempt-weighted
conditional TVD across `<30`, `30–39`, `40–49`, and `50+` yards (τ = 0.05). Drive outcomes use TVD
≤ 0.05 over TD, FG attempt (made and missed combined), punt, turnover, downs, safety, and period
expiry. Fourth-quarter share excludes overtime from both numerator and denominator.

College Q4 share is `Q4 points / Q1–Q4 points`. The public band is **26.047110%…26.690304%**:
2022, 2023, and 2024 FBS-vs-FBS play-by-play aggregates were 26.690304%, 26.047110%, and 26.281284%,
respectively. The two-tier TOST margin is half that annual width, **±0.321597 pp**. Source and method:
the downloadable [Sports Data Stuff CFB PBP dataset](https://www.sportsdatastuff.com/cfb_pbpdata),
filter completed FBS-vs-FBS plays, sum `score_pts` in period 4 and periods 1–4 per season. **[Q]**

College-specific: higher plays per game, wider scoring variance, and a **talent-dispersion band** —
the win-rate-vs-rating-gap curve must be materially steeper than pro, because a top programme
against a bottom one is not a coin flip. §6.4 found a ~64-point spread across FBS; a generated
league that does not reproduce that spread fails D6 as well as calibration.

### 5.2 Overtime band — a note on scar tissue

The prior suite's overtime band was `0.008…0.14`, a seventeen-fold range. That is what widening a
band to stop a false failure looks like. Under TOST the correct response to a band that will not
hold is to fix the model or state the margin honestly, never to widen until green.

---

## 6. The soak

Twenty seasons, seeded, run headless, asserting:

- Ratings distribution stays inside band across all ~134 college programmes and 32 pro teams.
- Age and roster-size distributions stay legal; no roster illegal at any week boundary.
- Cap legality holds for every pro team (bounded overage from dead money only).
- Scholarship and eligibility legality holds for every college programme.
- Churn is within band — the league neither ossifies nor scrambles.
- **Save size stays under the D4 ceiling**, and every bounded collection in D7 is verified bounded
  by growth check, not by inspection.
- Job security moves (D8's falsifier), and coach tenure distribution stays in band.
- The two legal tests pass at every generated league.

---

## 7. Performance budgets (D4)

Restated here as the engine's contract; derived from the college case and now measured against an
iPhone 15-class device per the 2026-08-11 platform baseline.

| Budget | Target | Hard ceiling |
|---|---|---|
| Week advance, college (~65 games + recruiting/portal AI, ~134 programmes) | 1.2 s | **2.0 s** |
| Week advance, pro | 0.3 s | 0.6 s |
| Full-season sim, college | 20 s | 35 s |
| Match render frame | 8 ms | **16.7 ms** |
| Save size, 20 seasons | 4 MB | **8 MB** |
| Cold launch to playable | 1.2 s | 2.0 s |
| Save write (never on the main actor) | 150 ms | 400 ms |

The dominant week-advance term is recruiting AI across ~134 programmes, and it has **never been
measured** — flagged as an assumption in `01-RESEARCH.md` §6.2A and §6.4. If the ceiling cannot be
met, D14's fallback reduces the programme count rather than loosening the ceiling.

---

## 8. Known gaps in this document

Stated plainly rather than papered over:

1. **The presentation-time constants** that D1's arithmetic multiplies by (seconds per drive summary,
   seconds per call-in) are proposals, not measurements. They need the owner protocol in
   `01-RESEARCH.md` §6.0 §8 and one layout measurement in Xcode.
2. **Recruiting-AI cost** is unmeasured, as above.
3. **College clock rules** must be confirmed against the current rule book before the tier constants
   are fixed.
4. **Model-vs-model agreement for the recruiting/portal AI** is not covered by §4.1's bands, which
   cover game outcomes only. If the abstracted recruiting AI produces different class quality than a
   detailed one would, the league drifts over 20 seasons. The soak's churn assertion is a partial
   proxy; a proper band is unspecified work.

---

## 9. The anchor contract (G-06)

`04` §9 requires a match view that animates what the engine recorded and cannot invent movement.
This section is the engine half of that requirement: what an anchor set contains, what makes it
legal, and what it may never contradict.

### 9.1 What an anchor set is

A **sparse** spatial description of one already-resolved snap, derived from its `PlayRecord`. It
holds twenty-two actor anchors, a ball polyline, the deciding matchup, a foreground list, a playback
duration and an accessible sentence. It holds no probabilities, no resolution and no route that the
record does not justify.

Sparse is the operative word. Most actors on most snaps have a start and an end and nothing between
them, because the record says nothing more about them. A dense anchor set would have to be invented,
and `04` §9 forbids that.

### 9.2 Coordinate space

Anchors are **offense-relative**. `yard` runs 0 to 100 from the offence's own goal line, matching
`Situation.yardLine`. `lateral` runs 0 to 1 across the field.

The engine never learns which way the offence is facing. Direction is presentation, it is recorded
on the read model as `MatchFieldDirection`, and the provider applies it when converting to the drawn
field's absolute 0-to-120 space — which carries ten yards of end zone at each end. This is what gives
`04` §9's "the view never guesses from home/away colour" exactly one place to live.

### 9.3 Legality

An anchor set is legal when all of the following hold. Each is a test.

1. **Pure.** A function of the `PlayRecord` and the two player lists, with no random source, no clock
   and no engine reference. The same input yields a byte-identical encoding, in any process.
2. **Consistent with the box score.** `endSpot - lineOfScrimmage` equals `outcome.yards`. The carrier
   named in the ball polyline is `outcome.ballCarrierID`. An incompletion has no carry segment. A
   sack ends behind the line.
3. **Complete.** Given eleven players a side, exactly twenty-two actor anchors, and at most three
   foregrounded, per `04` §9.
4. **On the field.** Every point lies within the coordinate space of §9.2.
5. **Total.** Every `SnapResult` yields a legal set. There is no input a resolved snap can present
   that has no anchor set, so construction cannot fail.

Clause 5 is why the foreground cap is met by construction rather than by validation, and why
`FieldPoint` clamps in its initialiser. A contract that can reject a resolved snap is a contract that
can leave the view with nothing to draw for something that demonstrably happened.

### 9.4 Alignment

Per-snap alignment is not recorded, and recording it would be a calibration problem of its own. The
starts come from a fixed template keyed on `Position`, and the ends from the identities the outcome
already records — `passerID`, `targetID`, `ballCarrierID`, and the deciding matchup's two players.

`04` §9 permits this in terms: route-tree and formation notation are drawn conventions of the sport
and not protected expression. It continues to refuse any specific playbook's diagrams, and nothing
here reproduces one.

The template is engine-side rather than view-side because it is part of what makes an anchor set
deterministic and testable. A template living in the view would be geometry no test could see.

### 9.5 Bound

Nothing is persisted. An anchor set is derived on demand from a `PlayRecord` that the save already
holds under D7's current-game play-by-play bound, so G-06 adds no save growth at all.

### 9.6 Template motion (amended 2026-08-22)

**The rule this section used to state was: only what the record names may move. That rule shipped,
and what it produced is a diagram of chips.** Measured over 200 resolved snaps, 62% of actor-snaps
had `end == start` - 13.6 of the 22 on every snap never moved at all, with coverage, run fits and
decoys frozen 100% of the time. Every mover slid start-to-end in one straight line at constant
velocity across the whole playback. The owner's judgement on watching it on device (2026-08-22) is
that it does not read as football, and that is the gate `04` §9 exists to protect.

The rule was also **inconsistent with §9.4, which is the thing that resolves it.** §9.4 already
accepts invented geometry for something the record does not hold: nobody's *stance* is recorded
either, and the starts come from a template anyway. A pursuit path is no more unrecorded than a
stance. What made one acceptable and the other forbidden was never a principle - it was where the
line happened to be drawn.

So the line moves, to where the principle actually is:

> **A recorded fact is inviolable. Unrecorded geometry may come from a deterministic template.
> A template may never assert a fact.**

**Recorded facts** - the ones a template may never contradict, reshape or soften:

- the end spot, and that it equals the line of scrimmage plus the recorded yardage (§9.3 clause 2)
- who had the ball, when, and every leg of the ball's own journey
- the identity of the man the record names as ending the play, and that he is the one who ends it
- who won each recorded duel
- the sentence a VoiceOver user hears, which is derived from the record alone (§9.8)

**Template motion** is permitted for everything else, under four constraints, all four testable:

1. **Deterministic and rng-free.** Derived from the record and the §9.4 template only.
   `choreograph` stays pure and total; two runs over one `PlayRecord` produce identical paths.
2. **Asserts nothing.** No template may draw a tackle, a block won, a catch, a turnover or a stop
   that the record does not name. Convergence short of the ball is movement; convergence *onto* the
   ball is a claim, and only the recorded tackler may make it.
3. **Consistent with the record at every instant, not merely at the end.** A man cannot be drawn
   somewhere the record says the ball was not, and two actors the record says met must meet.
4. **Bounded by plausibility, not by precision.** A template says "a corner covering this receiver
   goes roughly here"; it does not claim to know that he did. Where the record holds the real
   answer, the real answer wins.

**The tackle, restated.** The defender the record names still ends where the ball ends, arriving as
it arrives - that part was right and does not change. What changes is that he is no longer the only
man on the field who moves toward the play. Other defenders converge *toward* the end spot and stop
short of it, at a distance that keeps constraint 2: visibly chasing, and visibly not the man who
made the stop. When the carrier won his duel, nobody reaches him at all, exactly as before.

**Motion has a shape.** A straight line at constant velocity for the full playback is not a neutral
default; it is a claim that players do not accelerate, which is false and reads as false. Template
paths carry a stride profile - acceleration off the snap, deceleration into contact, and phase
timings that end a route when the ball arrives rather than when the whistle blows. The profile is a
rules constant in `AnchorRules`, applied identically to every actor and to the ball, so nothing can
desynchronise from the man carrying it.

### 9.7 What a template may not invent (amended 2026-08-22)

The gap §9.7 used to list - blocking, route shapes, broken tackles - closes under §9.6, because none
of those was ever refused on the grounds that drawing it would be *untrue*. They were refused on the
grounds that they were unrecorded, and §9.6 no longer treats unrecorded as undrawable.

What stays refused, and why it is a different kind of thing:

1. **A specific playbook's route tree.** `04` §9's legal limb, untouched: route-tree notation is a
   drawn convention of the sport; a named programme's actual concepts are someone's expression. A
   template draws a depth and a break, never a catalogued concept.
2. **Any mark that reads as an event the record does not hold.** A collision, a pile, a flag, a
   fumble the record did not record. Motion is not an event; a mark is.
3. **Anything that changes what the simulation decided.** `04` §9's closing line stands in full:
   animation visualises an already-recorded outcome and cannot change simulation truth. A template
   is drawn *from* the record and can never feed back into it.

### 9.8 The accessible equivalent is record-only

Stated separately because it is the one place the amendment must not reach. `SnapAnchors.sentence`
is derived from the outcome and the two rosters, and from nothing a template produced. A VoiceOver
user hears what the record says happened; they never hear a plausible path described as a fact.
