# Screen Reachability and Role Map

Date: 2026-08-19
Scope: production gameplay in `CoachWorldAppRootView`; DEBUG proof routing is excluded.

## Verdict

- The registry contains **62 stable route IDs**: **47 canonical tasks** and **15 legacy aliases**.
- All 47 canonical tasks have a production rendering path under at least one real game state.
- The 15 alias wrapper views are **not independently reachable**. The router canonicalizes their IDs before rendering; this is intentional retirement, but their dead switch branches and source-only reachability tests obscure that fact.
- Role gating is mostly driven by optional read models and correctly separates college acquisition from the pro front office.
- The current UI still has **three role/scenario reachability defects** and **13 misleading legacy links**:
  1. Pro coaches see `Recruit` links that can only fail.
  2. `Realignment Event` is advertised to pro coaches and when no realignment event exists.
  3. `Promotion Decision` is advertised to pro coaches and when no actionable college-to-pro offer exists.
  4. The HQ `World` menu still advertises 13 retired route names even though All Tasks correctly hides aliases.

## Production navigation map

```text
Title / Continue
├── Settings & Accessibility
└── New Career & Coach Identity
    └── College appointment
        └── Coaching HQ
            ├── fixed rail: HQ · Inbox · Roster · Game Plan · Film · Health · All Tasks
            ├── All Tasks: canonical routes whose read model currently exists
            ├── contextual routes: player/prospect/team profiles, plans, match and box score
            ├── Advance week → Match Day → Aftermath → Game Detail / Box Score
            └── Career Hub → accept professional opportunity
                └── same career becomes a pro appointment; college models disappear and pro models appear
```

The shared All Tasks overlay is the closest thing to a truthful router. It filters on both canonicality and current read-model availability. The fixed rail and older screen-local/HQ menus do not consistently use that filtered set.

## Legend

- **Direct**: a distinct canonical production surface is rendered.
- **Conditional**: rendered only in a matching simulation phase/state.
- **Alias → X**: the legacy ID is accepted, but the named wrapper view never renders; the player lands on X.
- **Entry**: reachable outside an active career.
- **C / P**: appropriate for college / pro careers.
- **Leak**: advertised where the route is irrelevant or guaranteed to refuse.

## Confirmed defects

### 1. Pro careers advertise an unreachable college route

`Recruit` is unconditional in Coaching HQ's primary strip and World menu, Roster's standard and accessibility navigation, and League Map's route bar. `navigate(.recruitingBoard)` then refuses because the pro store correctly has no recruiting read model.

Evidence:

- `Sources/ProFootballCoachUI/CoachingHQView.swift:129,158`
- `Sources/ProFootballCoachUI/RosterView.swift:117,737`
- `Sources/ProFootballCoachUI/LeagueMapView.swift:163`
- `Sources/CoachWorldApp/CoachWorldAppRootView.swift:1221-1237`

### 2. Retired aliases remain visible

All Tasks correctly filters aliases with `isCanonicalTask`, but HQ's World menu bypasses that source of truth. It advertises 13 retired names: Job Board, Offers, Appointment, Scheme Book, Personnel Packages, Staff Market & Profile, Portal Hub, Retention Decisions, Portal Market, NIL Allocation, Draft Board, Free Agency, and Pro Scouting Board.

The tap works only by canonicalizing to another task. The corresponding alias cases in `career(_:)` cannot execute because the switch input is already canonicalized.

Evidence:

- `Sources/ProFootballCoachUI/ScreenRegistry.swift:111-143`
- `Sources/ProFootballCoachUI/CoachingHQView.swift:151-215`
- `Sources/CoachWorldApp/CoachWorldAppRootView.swift:90,1154-1163`

### 3. Realignment is a college-only, event-only screen exposed everywhere

`realignment(from:)` returns a model for any career with a coach, including pro careers and seasons with no realignment. Both All Tasks and the HQ menu therefore advertise the route.

Evidence:

- `Sources/CoachWorldApp/CoachWorldRealignmentProvider.swift:6-36`
- `Sources/CoachWorldApp/CoachWorldAppRootView.swift:1112,1209-1212`
- `Sources/ProFootballCoachUI/CoachingHQView.swift:173`

### 4. Promotion is not scenario-gated

Promotion Decision appears whenever `careerHub != nil`. The focused panel is just the generic opportunity workspace, and a current pro appointment cannot accept another professional opportunity. The route should be college-only and conditional on an actionable professional offer, or be renamed to a general Opportunities task.

Evidence:

- `Sources/CoachWorldApp/CoachWorldAppRootView.swift:1115-1117,1332-1341`
- `Sources/CoachWorldApp/CoachWorldCareerProvider.swift:65-113`
- `Sources/ProFootballCoachUI/CareerHubView.swift:228-262`

### 5. Shared league intelligence is inconsistently tier-scoped

Standings, Schedule, Rankings, and Bracket receive the controlled tier. Statistics scans every player's statistics, and Awards merges every archived award from both tiers. If these are meant to be global, the UI should say so; if the requirement is strict role relevance, they need the same tier input as the other competition screens.

Evidence:

- `Sources/CoachWorldApp/CoachWorldStore.swift:99-112`
- `Sources/CoachWorldApp/CoachWorldStatisticsProvider.swift:6-71`

## Unreachable code and verification gap

The 15 alias wrapper views and their cases are dead as distinct production screens. Current contract tests can still report them as reachable because they search source text for `case .screen` and `ScreenView(` rather than driving the production router. The `62 converted` accessibility result likewise proves file-level composition, not gameplay reachability.

The missing regression check is a runtime matrix with at least these roots:

1. ordinary college week;
2. college signing phase;
3. controlled college match and aftermath;
4. college career with actionable pro offer;
5. ordinary pro week;
6. pro draft phase;
7. fired/seeking coach with no controlled team.

For each root, assert the exact advertised canonical task set and that every visible control reaches a non-refusal destination. This one matrix would catch the Recruit, Realignment, Promotion, and stale-alias problems above.

## Verification performed

- GitNexus index refreshed against the current checkout and navigation/game-control flows traced.
- `swift run SimTests --design-contracts`: **43 tests, 663 checks, passed**.
- `swift run SimTests --screen-read-models`: **66 tests, 9,695 checks, passed**.
- The passing lanes validate registry/read-model contracts; neither currently validates the role/scenario navigation matrix described above.
